# rpiGPIOserial-to-mysql
cross compile linux eclipse project for raspberry pi GPIO serial port save data to mySQL database

This project started as a fun idea to just cross-compile in my "desktop" linux, creating binaries to execute on the raspberry pi.  This quickly led to, "Hey!  I should log the data into a databse!"
Which of course led to, "If it's in a standard databse, then I can show the stuff on web pages or serve up the data via some REST APIs!"

So, it's a work in progress, and a fun project so far.
